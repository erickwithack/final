        <div class="merits">
            <h3 class="animate__animated animate__slideInLeft">Merits</h3>
            Our device has three merits that the traditional products available in the market currently lack: independence, ease of use and customizability:

            <ul id="list">
                <li>The device is easy to don because of the lever mechanism, allowing a clenched fist to be easily open</li>
                <li>
                    It is easy and simple to use because of its intuitive design and minimal components

                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, HandyMani is dome shaped in order to fit the natural hand resting position of the user’s affected hand.

                </li>


            </ul>
            <p>
                Other advantages to our design include portability and comfort. Our device is also made out of polyethylene, a hard plastic that is acetone resistant therefore allowing the user to receive manicures without having to worry about damaging the device. One
                limitation of our product is that it is not ambidextrous since it is only suited for the left hand. In addition, our design cannot enable the user to do their nails by themself; it is only used when they are having their nails done by
                a professional.

            </p>
