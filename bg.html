            Working alongside our client, Ms.Courtney Celian, an occupational therapist at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (“SRAL”), we designed a device that helps patients who have had a stroke and have their hand stuck in flexor synergy open their hands long enough
            for them to have their nails cut as well as receive manicures. Patients who have had a stroke attend therapy sessions at SRAL, which are meant to stimulate the undamaged parts of the brain to regain cognition of the affected arms. Our device
            is intended to help patients receive proper nail care by allowing them to extend their fingers and therefore have each of their nails accessed.

            After doing background research on flexor synergy, competitive products, and models available in the market for hand rehabilitation , as well as interviewing our client , we built four mockups of different design and functionality. We proceeded to test
            each of our mockups with our user and collected feedback. Based on the feedback, we deduced a final design that we deemed was best for the user. Suggestions from our peers, our client, and our DTC supervisors (Prof. Deborah Wood and Emma DeCosta)
            helped confirm our new design idea.
