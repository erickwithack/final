            Patients who have suffered from stroke tend to have their arms, or part of their arm stuck in flexor energy: a state in which the elbow, shoulder and/or wrist is fixed in a particular position therefore limiting rotational movement at the joints and consequently
            limiting forearm movement. To help these patients regain control of their arms, health institutions require them to attend therapy sessions aimed at stimulating the undamaged parts of the brain to acquire a somewhat cognition of the affected
            arms and therefore making it easier for patients with stroke to move their hands. In the interim, these patients experience difficulty grasping and holding objects as well as maintaining proper nail hygiene or getting manicures by professionals.

            In coordination with our client, Ms. Courtney Celian (Occupational Therapist from the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab), we were able to make our design. Our design is made out of hard plastic (polyethylene) which is notably acetone resistant. It is also elliptical
            shaped, in order to enable the user to get her affected hand around the device with ease while also fitting the natural hand resting position of her left (affected) hand. The resting surface of the design is vertical to enable her fingers
            to stick out at the front allowing for a technician to access her nails. It also has individual finger grooves where each finger should rest, and a Velcro strap that she could use to strap her first knuckles onto the design and hold them in
            position, therefore ultimately extending her hand. Our device is also portable and comfortable for the user.
